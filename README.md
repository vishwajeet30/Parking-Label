#Parking Label Generation System
The web application facilitates the users in generating parking labels for their vehicles as well as in renewing their existing parking labels if expired. The project also allows the admin to issue and control parking labels for granting permission to authorized personnel. The database maintains the records for the parking labels as well as user details in addition to using this system for security issues such as preventing unauthorized personnel from entering the premises.
